# kittenquest
Kitten Quest is a text-based game (think: Zork) with the goal of finding and saving all of the kittens.  They will be randomly placed in locations around the grid during each run of the game.  Once all are saved, the gamer will get a medal.

This is a project intended to help @elorabella learn how git, java, and maven function.
